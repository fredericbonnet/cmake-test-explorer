  the old Test Explorer adapter

### Added

### Removed

- `cmakeExplorer.buildDir` configuration is no longer needed thanks to
  auto-detection of build directories

## [0.17.4] - 2024-05-04

### Fixed

- Revert previous fix for issue #68 and rely on [workspace
  trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust) instead.
  This addresses issue #73.

## [0.17.3] - 2024-04-08

### Added

- Add decorations for error messages (thanks @appden!)
- Add `cmakeExplorer.errorPattern` for error message capture

## [0.14.1] - 2021-05-22

### Fixed

- Pass build config when running tests. This fixes issue #31.

## [0.14.0] - 2021-05-15

  implements issue #28.

## Fixed

- Pass environment variables to debugged tests. This fixes issue #25.

## [0.12.0] - 2021-01-05

### Changed

- Refactor test execution to use the native Ctest scheduler instead of letting
  the extension handle test process execution itself. This fixes issue #23 and
  should prevent future similar issues with resource locks/groups/fixtures/etc.

## [0.11.0] - 2020-11-07

### Added

- Add support for linking tests with source files. This implements issue #19.

## [0.10.1] - 2020-11-04

### Fixed

- Fix debug configuration handling with debuggers other than 'cppdbg' (see issue
  #22)

## [0.10.0] - 2020-08-28

### Added

- Add possibility to group tests based on delimiter in their names (thanks
  @macdems!)

### Changed

- No longer wait for CMake Tools during activation. This prevents issues with
  tests failing to load when CMake Tools integration is activated but the
  extension is not installed or activated (see issue #15).

### Fixed

- Fix issue #17 for tests with non-default `WORKING_DIRECTORY`

## [0.9.0] - 2020-07-28

### Added

- Add parallel tests execution (thanks @macdems!)

## [0.8.0] - 2020-07-14

- Add [CMake Tools][cmake-tools] integration

Thanks to @andrewbridge for these contributions!

## [0.7.0] - 2020-06-29

### Added

- Add custom debug configurations

## [0.6.0] - 2020-05-03

### Added

- Add preliminary debug support

## [0.5.0] - 2020-03-01

### Added

- Add support for extra CTest command-line arguments

## [0.4.0] - 2019-12-02

### Fixed

- Run tests with CTest instead of executing the test commands directly. This
  fixes a number of issues with CTest options such as `PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`.
  Fixes issues #4 and #5.

## [0.3.1] - 2019-11-01

### Changed

- Update README with the new `cmakeExplorer.buildConfig` setting

## [0.3.0] - 2019-11-01

### Added

- Add support for build configurations

## [0.2.0] - 2019-10-06

### Added

- Check that buildDir exists before loading tests
- Add CTest path autodetect from CMakeCache.txt file; this should avoid useless
  creation of `Testing` subdirs in non-CMake project dirs

### Changed

- Add better error message when using CTest version < 3.14

## [0.1.0] - 2019-08-19

### Added
